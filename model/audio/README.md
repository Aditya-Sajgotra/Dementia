# Dementia-From-Speech

This repository contains code for predicting Alzheimer's disease using a non-linguistic approach, i.e., only acoustic features so as to make Alzheimer's disease detection language neutral.

The dataset used in this project is the "ADReSSo-2021", provided by [Dementia TalkBank](https://dementia.talkbank.org/).
